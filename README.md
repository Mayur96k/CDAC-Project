# CDAC-Project- Resume screening using NLP & and Machine Learning Algorithm 

The project typically involves the following steps:

    1.Data collection: Gather a large dataset of resumes, ideally with diverse backgrounds and job roles. This dataset will be used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

    2.Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the resume data to remove irrelevant information, such as formatting, special characters, and stopwords. This step may also include techniques like tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to normalize the text.

    3.Feature extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed resumes. This could involve techniques such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe. These features represent the resumes in a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can process.

   4.Labeling or classification: Assign labels or categories to the resumes based on specific criteria. For example, if the job requires a certain skill set or experience level, resumes can be classified into "relevant" or "not relevant" categories accordingly. This step often requires manual labeling of a subset of the data by human experts to serve as training examples for the machine learning model.

    5.Model training: Train a machine learning model using the labeled dataset. Common algorithms used for resume screening include logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), random forests, or deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or recurrent neural networks (RNN).

    6.Model evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. This step helps determine the effectiveness of the model and identify areas for improvement.

    7.Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a production environment where it can be used to automatically screen and rank new resumes based on their relevance to the job position. The model takes in a resume as input, applies the learned patterns and features, and outputs a prediction or score indicating the suitability of the candidate.
